# Project Overview

My project is focused on developing a dynamic pricing model that utilizes both Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) techniques and hierarchical modeling. The primary goal of this initiative is to create adaptive pricing strategies that can effectively tackle different business scenarios. These strategies are designed to:

- Maximize Revenue: Optimize pricing to increase revenue without compromising competitive positioning.
- Increase Sales Volume: Implement pricing adjustments that can boost sales, particularly useful for promotions or in peak demand periods.
- Clear Old Inventory: Use strategic price reductions to manage and reduce excess stock efficiently.
- Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Develop pricing strategies that maintain fairness and foster customer loyalty, thereby enhancing overall customer satisfaction.

## Methodology

My approach combines the robustness of hierarchical modeling with the agility of Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms:

- Hierarchical Modeling: This technique helps structure the pricing strategy according to different market levels and customer segments. It allows the model to adapt based on varying factors such as location, customer demographics, or product category, providing a tailored pricing approach.
- Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB): Within the broader hierarchical framework, I use MAB to dynamically test and optimize various pricing strategies. This helps in efficiently finding a balance between exploiting known profitable strategies and exploring new ones that might yield better results.
- Customer Segmentation: To better tailor our pricing strategies, I segment customers based on their behavior, preferences, and demographic profiles. This allows for more targeted and effective pricing that can meet diverse customer needs and enhance engagement.
- Demand Forecasting: By predicting future demand trends based on historical data and market analysis, I can adjust pricing strategies proactively. This forecasting helps ensure that our pricing decisions are aligned with expected market conditions, balancing supply and demand effectively.
